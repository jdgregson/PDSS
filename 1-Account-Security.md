# 1. Account Security
Section 1 of the Paranoid Digital Security Standard sets forth standard account security controls for online accounts.


## 1.1 Password Policies

### 1.1.1 Password Strength Requirements
Passwords MUST be a minimum of twelve (12) characters. Passwords MUST contain characters form AT LEAST two of the following character sets:
  * Lower case alphabet (a-z).
  * Upper case alphabet (A-Z).
  * Numbers (0-9).
  * Common keyboard symbols (~-/).

Passwords MUST NOT contain a dictionary word from any known language. Passwords MAY contain a pronounceable set of characters, such as a made-up word. A password generated by a password manager is ideal.

### 1.1.2 Password Expiration and Reset
Passwords MUST NOT expire arbitrarily, such as after a certain period of time. Passwords MUST be changed after notice of a breach or suspected breach of the service, or a suspected breach of the account.

### 1.1.3 Password Storage
Passwords MUST be stored in an encrypted form, such as a password manager or VeraCrypt/TrueCrypt file. Being saved on an encrypted hard drive does not meet this requirement, though per *[insert future standard]*, all data MUST be stored on an encrypted medium.

### 1.1.4 Password Transmission
Passwords MUST NOT be entered into web pages or any other application served over an unencrypted channel.

### 1.1.5 Password Reuse
Individual passwords MUST NOT be used with more than one account.


## 1.2 Multi-Factor Authentication

### 1.2.1 Where Required
Multi-Factor Authentication as detailed in this section MUST be enabled on ALL accounts where:
  * The account is an email account and the email address was used to create accounts with other services.
  * The account stores payment information (PCI data, PayPal authorization, etc.).
  * Any other account is configured to use the account as a multi-factor authentication authenticator, password recovery, or account recovery mechanism.

Multi-Factor Authentication as detailed in this section MAY be disabled on accounts where:
  * There are no dependent accounts.
  * No payment information is stored.

### 1.2.2 Multi-Factor Authenticators
An Authenticator is one of the factors used in a multi-factor authentication scheme, such as a hardware key or TOTP application installed on a phone or tablet.

Accounts MUST be configured to use AT LEAST two of the following authenticators (in addition to a unique password):
  * Hardware key, such as a Yubikey, using a current standard (such as FIDO, FIDO2, WebAuthn, etc.).
  * A TOTP application, such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator.
  * Backup codes (a set of secret codes which can only be used once and do not otherwise expire).
  * Biometrics, such as a fingerprint or iris scan.

Accounts MAY be configured to use ANY of the following authenticators:
  * An email account IF the account which receives the codes is itself compliant with this standard.[1]
  * An SMS message sent to an online SMS system, e.g. a Skype or Google Voice number.[1]
  * A phone call placed to a landline or business telephony system.[1]

Accounts SHOULD NOT be configured to use ANY of the following authenticators:
  * Facial recognition.[2]

Accounts MUST NOT be configured to use ANY of the following authenticators:
  * SMS or "text" messages sent to a mobile phone.
  * A phone call placed to a mobile phone.

### 1.2.3 Safeguarding Physical Authenticators
ANY physical authenticator, such as a hardware key or backup code, MUST remain in close proximity to the account holder when in regular use. When not in regular use, ANY physical authenticator MUST be stored in a locked container, such as a safe or a safe deposit box. ANY physical authenticator SHOULD NOT be accessed by ANYONE other than the account holder.

### 1.2.4 Safeguarding Digital Authenticators
ANY device used to store and provide TOTP codes or that is logged into an email account which receives multi-factor authentication codes MUST:
  * Utilize full-disk encryption.
  * Have a pass code, password, or biometric prompt which restricts access to the user profile and applications.

ANY device used to store and provide TOTP codes SHOULD:
  * Utilize a second pass code, password, or biometric prompt which restricts access to the TOTP application.

ANY device used to store and provide TOTP codes MUST NOT:
  * Allow a code to be visible without authenticating into the user profile (e.g. on the lock screen).
  * Allow a login attempt to be approved from the lock screen (e.g. through a "yes" or "no" push notification).
  * Have the device's boot integrity or boot verification features disabled (e.g. "Secure Boot" or OEM locking).
  * Have the operating system deliberately modified to allow user elevation of privilege (e.g. "jail breaking" for Apple devices or "rooting" for Android devices).


## 1.3 Separation of Privilege

### 1.3.1 Separate Administrative Accounts
ANY user who is assigned administrative duties MUST use a separate account to carry out administrative tasks. Accounts used regularly for tasks such as sending emails and editing content MUST NOT have access to administrative features that can affect other user accounts.

[2]: An attacker could bypass facial recognition by coercing or tricking the account holder into looking at the facial recognition cameras.
